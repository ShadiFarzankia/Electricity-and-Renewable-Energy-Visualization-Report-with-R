## üìä Data Sources
This project uses publicly available datasets from two main sources:

1. **[ENTSO-E (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity)](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/time_series/)**  
   Provides hourly electricity consumption, generation, and forecast data across European countries.  
   - Variables used: actual load, forecasted load, solar generation, wind generation (Germany and France).

- **[DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst)](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/hourly/)** ‚Äì Hourly temperature data for major German cities.

## üßº Data Preprocessing

To ensure clean, comparable time series across sources, we applied the following steps:

1. **Time alignment**
   - Parsed timestamps (`lubridate`) and standardized to **UTC**.
   - Harmonized granularities to **hourly** and aligned ENTSO-E (UTC) with DWD (local ‚Üí UTC).

2. **Weather data cleaning (DWD)**
   - Treated **missing sentinel values** (`-999`) in temperature as NA.
   - Filtered to validated measurements (**`QN_9 == 3`** where applicable).
   - Selected five major cities (**Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich, Cologne, Hamburg**) and computed a **national hourly mean temperature**.

3. **Electricity data cleaning (ENTSO-E)**
   - Selected Germany (DE) and France (FR) series for: **actual load**, **forecasted load**, **solar generation**, **wind generation**.
   - Imputed occasional gaps with **variable-wise mean imputation** (short, sparse missingness), preserving series continuity for rolling stats.

4. **Feature engineering**
   - Extracted **year, month, day, hour**, and created **7-day rolling averages** (`slider`) for solar and wind.
   - Derived daily aggregates (e.g., **GWh/day** for temperature‚Äìdemand analysis).

5. **Merging & consistency checks**
   - Joined electricity and weather tables on the **hourly timestamp**.
   - Ran sanity checks for duplicate timestamps, monotonic time, and post-join completeness.

> üîé Note: Mean imputation was chosen due to low missingness and to maintain continuity for visualization. For modeling, consider time-aware methods (e.g., Kalman smoothing, seasonal decomposition, or KNN imputation).
